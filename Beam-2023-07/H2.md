# [H2] Unlimited Minting of Merit NFTs

## Summary
The MeritNFT contract, which is responsible for minting NFTs, suffers from a critical vulnerability that allows unauthorized minting beyond the specified caps. While the AuctionMerit contract implements limits on the number of NFTs that can be minted per address and an overall minting cap, these limits are not enforced in the MeritNFT contract itself. This vulnerability enables an attacker with the `MINTER_ROLE` to bypass the caps and mint an unlimited number of tokens, leading to an inflationary supply and undermining the integrity and value of the protocol.

## Description
The MeritNFT contract defines a maximum number of NFTs that can be minted per address (CAP_PER_ADDRESS) and an overall cap on the total number of NFTs that can be minted (MINT_CAP). However, these caps are not enforced within the MeritNFT contract itself. As a result, an attacker with the `MINTER_ROLE` can directly call the `mint()` function of the MeritNFT contract, bypassing the caps imposed by the AuctionMerit contract.

## Exploitation Scenario
If an attacker obtains the `MINTER_ROLE` and identifies the MeritNFT contract address used by the AuctionMerit contract, they can execute the following steps to exploit the vulnerability:
1. Obtain the MeritNFT contract address from the AuctionMerit contract.
2. Call the `mint()` function of the MeritNFT contract repeatedly, minting NFTs beyond the defined caps.
3. By bypassing the caps, the attacker can inflate the token supply indefinitely, undermining the token's scarcity and diminishing its value.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes:
- **Inflationary Supply**: Unauthorized minting beyond the defined caps leads to an excessive supply of NFTs, resulting in reduced scarcity and diminishing the value of the tokens.
- **Loss of Trust**: Users may lose trust in the protocol if the minting caps are not upheld, as it undermines the fairness and integrity of the system.
- **Economic Disruption**: The unauthorized minting disrupts the economic balance of the ecosystem, potentially impacting the market value of the tokens and the overall health of the platform.

## Tool used

Foundry, Manual Review


## PoC
To demonstrate the vulnerability, a foundry test was conducted. The following test case showcases the ability of an attacker to mint more NFTs than the specified cap:

```solidity
function test_MintMoreThanCap() public {
    vm.startPrank(minter);
    console.log("-----------------------");
    uint bal = nft.balanceOf(attacker);
    console.log("Attacker balance before: ", bal);

    for (uint i = 1; i <= 20000; i++) {
        nft.mint(i, attacker);
    }
    bal = nft.balanceOf(attacker);
    console.log("Attacker balance After: ", bal);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

The test case shows that an attacker with the `MINTER_ROLE` can mint 20000 NFTs, surpassing the specified cap, and inflate their balance without any enforcement.

## Mitigation
To address this vulnerability, the following mitigation measures are recommended:

1. **Cap Enforcement**: Modify the `mint()` function in the MeritNFT contract to include checks for the minting caps. Before minting an NFT, validate whether the total minted count and the count per address are within the defined limits. If the limits are exceeded, revert the transaction and prevent unauthorized unlimited minting.

By implementing cap enforcement within the MeritNFT contract, you can ensure that minting is restricted to the defined caps, preserving the scarcity and value of the NFTs.

## Severity
Based on the potential impact and the disruption it can cause to the token's value and trust in the protocol, I classify this vulnerability as **High** severity.

It is highly recommended to implement the suggested mitigation measures promptly to prevent unauthorized minting and maintain the integrity of the MeritNFT contract.
