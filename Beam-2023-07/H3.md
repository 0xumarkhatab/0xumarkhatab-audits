# [H3] Single point of Failure of Money , Trust and Reputation due to privatekeys compromise as Merlin Dex hack of 1.82M$

## Motivation: Recent Example: Merlin DEX Exploit

An incident involving the compromise of private keys and its impact on a decentralized exchange platform serves as a cautionary example. Merlin DEX experienced a security breach resulting in the loss of $1.82 million due to a compromised private key. The incident highlighted the importance of considering centralized risks and thoroughly auditing key aspects of a protocol.

### Summary

The AuctionMerit contract is vulnerable to the compromise of private keys associated with key roles, namely the Owner, Minter, and UriSetter. If any of these private keys are compromised, it can lead to severe consequences and compromise the overall security and integrity of the contract.

## Attack scenarios
The following issues can arise due to the private keys Compromise:

#### Owner Key Compromise:
If the private key of the Owner role is compromised, an attacker would gain complete control over the contract. They could potentially drain the funds held in the contract or make unauthorized changes to critical contract parameters.

#### Minter Key Compromise:
In the current implementation, the Minter role allows the minting of NFTs without any limit. If the private key of the Minter role is compromised, an attacker can mint an unlimited number of NFTs, disregarding the predefined minting limits. This would violate the overall accounting and value of the tokens on the platform, potentially leading to a devaluation of the NFTs and defaming the protocol.

#### UriSetter Key Compromise:
The UriSetter role is responsible for setting the tokenURI for each NFT. If the private key of the UriSetter role is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the tokenURI of NFTs, potentially setting them to empty strings (""). This would result in incorrect or missing metadata for the NFTs, negatively impacting the user experience and eroding trust in the platform.


### Impact

The compromise of any of these key roles can have severe consequences:

- Loss of Funds: Compromising the Owner key could result in the unauthorized transfer of funds held in the contract, leading to financial losses for the platform and its users.

- Unlimited Minting: If the Minter key is compromised, an attacker can mint an unlimited number of NFTs, leading to an overabundance of tokens and potentially devaluing the NFTs minted on the platform.

- Incorrect or Missing Metadata: A compromise of the UriSetter key could allow an attacker to manipulate the tokenURI of NFTs, leading to incorrect or missing metadata. This can undermine the trust of users who rely on accurate metadata for making informed decisions.


### Recommendation

To address the vulnerability of private key compromise, i would recommend Adopting a multisignature (multisig) mechanism for critical actions such as fund transfers or changes to key contract parameters. This requires multiple authorized parties to sign off on transactions, reducing the risk of a single compromised key compromising the entire contract.


By implementing these recommendations, particularly the adoption of multisig control and secure key management practices, the AuctionMerit contract can significantly reduce the risk of compromised key roles and protect the funds, minting process, and metadata integrity.

Please note that this vulnerability is classified as **High** severity due to the potential financial losses, devaluation of tokens, and erosion of user trust that can result from a compromise of private keys associated with key roles.
