# [H1] Lack of Admin Role Allocation in MeritNFT.sol can cause the contract to get stuck

## Summary
The MeritNFT contract, responsible for managing the minting and URI setting of NFTs, suffers from a critical vulnerability due to the absence of admin role allocation. This vulnerability can lead to potential operational issues, including excessive minting, the inability to set URIs for legitimate NFTs, and the risk of setting incorrect URIs, thus compromising user trust and experience. Additionally, the lack of an admin role prevents the revocation of compromised addresses or the assignment of new roles, potentially rendering the contract unmanageable.

## Description
The MeritNFT contract employs an access control mechanism using the AccessControlEnumerable contract from the OpenZeppelin library. However, during contract deployment, there is no allocation of the admin role, making it impossible to grant or revoke roles. As a result, the contract remains vulnerable to unauthorized activities, including excessive minting by compromised addresses and incorrect URI settings for NFTs.

## Exploitation Scenario:
If the private keys of addresses holding the `MINTER_ROLE` and `URI_SETTER` roles are compromised, there is no way to revoke their roles or assign new roles. This lack of control can lead to severe consequences:
1. **Excessive Minting**: Compromised addresses can continue minting NFTs indefinitely, exceeding the predefined limits of the contract, such as the maximum cap per address or the total minting cap.
2. **Invalid URI Settings**: Without the ability to assign the `URI_SETTER` role to a trusted address, there is a risk of setting incorrect URIs for legitimate NFTs. This can result in incorrect or misleading information associated with the NFTs, eroding user trust and undermining the value of the tokens.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes:
- Excessive inflation of the NFT supply, potentially devaluing the tokens.
- Loss of trust from users due to incorrect or misleading URI settings, affecting the NFTs' perceived value and authenticity.
- Inability to manage and control the roles assigned to addresses, compromising the contract's operational stability and security.

## PoC 
To highlight the vulnerability, a foundry test was conducted. The following test case demonstrates the inability to grant the `MINTER_ROLE` to a potential minter due to the lack of an admin role allocation:

```solidity
function testFail_ContractIsNotOwned() external {
    vm.startPrank(owner);

    console.log("-----------------------");
    nft.grantRole(nft.MINTER_ROLE(), potentialMinter);
    assertEq(nft.hasRole(nft.MINTER_ROLE(), potentialMinter), false);

    /**
     * [FAIL. Reason: AccessControl: account 0x0000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff4 is missing role 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000] 
     */
}
```

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, the following mitigation measures are recommended:

1. **Admin Role Allocation**: In the constructor of the MeritNFT contract, allocate the admin role (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) to a trusted address, typically the contract deployer. This role should have the authority to grant and revoke other roles.
2. **Role Management Functions**: Implement functions in the MeritNFT contract that allow the admin to grant or revoke roles to trusted addresses. These functions should be secured and accessible only to the admin role.

By allocating the admin role and implementing role management functions, you can regain control over role assignments and prevent unauthorized actions, ensuring the secure and intended operation of the MeritNFT contract.

**Severity:**
Based on the potential impact and operational risks associated with this vulnerability, I classify it as **High** severity.

I strongly recommend the immediate implementation of the suggested mitigation measures to safeguard the MeritNFT contract and protect the interests of its users.

**Code Example:**

```solidity
// MeritNFT.sol

// ...

constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    string memory _baseTokenURI,
    address _uriSetter,
    address _minter
) ERC721(_name, _symbol) {
    baseTokenURI_ = _baseTokenURI;
    _setupRole(URI_SETTER, _uriSetter);
    _setupRole(MINTER_ROLE, _minter);
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender); // Allocate admin role to the contract deployer
}
```

```solidity
// MeritNFT.sol

// ...

function grantAdminRole(address _newAdmin) external onlyAdmin {
    grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _newAdmin);
}

function revokeAdminRole(address _admin) external onlyAdmin {
    revokeRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _admin);
}
```

By adding the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` allocation in the constructor and implementing `grantAdminRole()` and `revokeAdminRole()` functions, you can manage the admin role, allowing for proper role assignment and revocation to ensure the secure operation of the MeritNFT contract.
